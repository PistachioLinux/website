    <h2>What's so cool about Pistachio?</h2>
    <div class="feature-grid">
        <div class="feature">
            <p class="feature-header">Secure</p>
            <p>Pistachio is frequently updated and runs Debian testing, so you won't miss out on the latest and greatest.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
            <p class="feature-header">Made for WSL</p>
            <p>Pistachio is developed on WSL and is only available for WSL. Put two and two together.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
            <p class="feature-header">Run any distro, with just Pistachio</p>
            <p>Pistachio uses containerization technology which allows you to run any Linux distro, with just Pistachio. You can run Arch, Debian, Fedora and more from Pistachio.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature">
            <p class="feature-header">Always free (as in freedom)</p>
            <p>Pistachio uses open-source technology, so why should it not be open source? All components of Pistachio Linux including <a href="https://github.com/PistachioLinux/website" target="_blank">this site</a> are open source.</p>

    <h2>A bit more about containers</h2>
    <p>Pistachio Linux comes with <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox">Distrobox</a>, which is a new cool Linux thing that allows you to run multiple distributions from an install using containers. And guess what, it works with WSL! Pistachio comes with Distrobox and Podman installed, and we also have our own wrapper called <code>pistachio-manager</code>, which makes it easier to use.</p>
    <p>Oh, yes. You don't need to install Docker on Pistachio. Podman is a drop-in replacement for Docker, and it's already installed. This makes Pistachio Linux amazing for developers and system administrators who have to work with containers.</p>
