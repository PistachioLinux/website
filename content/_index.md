        <h2>What's so cool about Pistachio?</h2>
        <div class="feature-grid">
            <div class="feature">
                <p class="feature-header">Secure</p>
                <p>Pistachio is frequently updated and runs Debian testing, so you won't miss out on the latest and greatest.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <p class="feature-header">Optimized for WSL</p>
                <p>Pistachio is developed on WSL and is only available for WSL. Put two and two together.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <p class="feature-header">Run any distro!</p>
                <p>Pistachio uses containerization technology which allows you to run any Linux distro. You can run Arch, Debian, Fedora and more from Pistachio. Having multiple distros installed in WSL is so yesterday!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <p class="feature-header">Always free (as in freedom)</p>
                <p>Pistachio uses open-source technology, so why should it not be open source? All components of Pistachio Linux including <a href="https://github.com/PistachioLinux/website" target="_blank">this site</a> are open source.</p>

        <h2>Community first, always</h2>
        <p>Pistachio Linux is a community project, and we always put the community first. We are always open to new ideas and we accept contributions from anyone. We develop in the open and we communicate with the community whenever we think a decision might be controversial.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="special-containers">
        <h2>Easy to use, and minimal</h2>
        <p>Since Pistachio Linux is based on Debian, it is easy to use and has a minimal learning curve, especially if you are already familiar with Debian. We also try to keep Pistachio fairly minimal, by not installing useless dependencies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="special-containers">
        <h2>Wrapping up</h2>
        <p>Pistachio Linux comes with a wrapper script for Distrobox called <code>pistachio-manager</code>, so that you can easily manage Distrobox containers. You can also deal with containers manually using podman or the distrobox script, but for creating containers, using <code>pistachio-manager</code> is recommended.</p>
